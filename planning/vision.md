# Vision

Build a trustworthy, read-only portfolio and risk analysis system
that helps individual investors understand their financial exposure
clearly without providing financial advice or execution capabilities.

The system should:
- Increase user clarity, not decision dependency
- Focus on transparency and explainability
- Avoid advisory, trading, or rebalancing actions

Success means:
- Users understand their portfolio risk in minutes
- Insights are data-driven and reproducible
- The platform remains compliant and low-liability
